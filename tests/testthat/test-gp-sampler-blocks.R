# A GP spatial main effect routes the whole model to cpp_hmc_fit_gp_v2. That
# entry used to be handed no spatiotemporal, latent, TVC or SVC bundle, so it
# built a ModelData without those blocks while q_init and hmc_param_layout()
# above it allocated and named their parameters. Every column from the dropped
# block onward was then read at the wrong offset and reported under the wrong
# name (gcol33/tulpaRatio#70).
#
# The arbiter is the prior support. A hyperparameter whose prior is uniform on
# (l, u) has a density of -Inf outside those bounds, so no draw of it can land
# there; a column that does is not that parameter. It reads the fit from the
# outside and needs no knowledge of the layout, which is what the mislabelling
# defeated.
