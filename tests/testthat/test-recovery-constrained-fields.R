# The multiscale RW2 fixture simulates eta = TRUE_INTERCEPT + TRUE_SLOPE * x
# with no trend, so sigma2_trend's true value is zero and the fit sits in the
# neck of a centred-parameterisation funnel by construction. Augmenting the
# constant raised the step size, which is what let the sampler reach the neck at
# all: the divergence count went 15 -> 38 out of 2000 while the intercept
# recovery was unchanged.
#
# A count alone cannot separate "reached further into a known funnel" from "a
# new pathology somewhere else", and it is not comparable across step sizes.
# What distinguishes them is WHERE the divergences sit. They belong at the small
# end of sigma2_trend and nowhere else; divergences spread across the range
# would be a different fault. The trend arm's non-centred coordinate is the fix
# (gcol33/tulpaRatio#79).
